    Logistic Regression is a type of statistical model used for binary classification tasks, 
    such as predicting whether a person has heart disease or not. It is based on the following equation:
    
    $$y = \sigma(wX + b)$$

    Where:
    - $y$ is the predicted probability of the outcome (i.e., heart disease).
    - $w$ represents the weights of the features.
    - $X$ is the feature vector (i.e., the inputs like age, sex, blood pressure, etc.).
    - $b$ is the bias term.
    - $\sigma$ is the **sigmoid function** that maps the linear combination of features to a probability value between 0 and 1.

    Logistic regression is an ideal choice for heart disease prediction because:
    - **Binary Classification**: The problem of predicting whether a person has heart disease or not is a binary classification task, 
      which aligns perfectly with logistic regression.
    - **Interpretable**: Logistic regression is a simple and interpretable model, making it easier to understand how the 
      input features (e.g., age, cholesterol, blood pressure) influence the prediction.
    - **Efficient**: Logistic regression performs well even with smaller datasets and is computationally efficient.
    - **Probabilistic Output**: The model provides probabilities, which allows us to measure the confidence of the prediction 
      (e.g., 80% chance of having heart disease).

    These characteristics make logistic regression a reliable model for predicting heart disease.
